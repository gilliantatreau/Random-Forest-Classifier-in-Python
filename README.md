# Random Forest Classifier
Random forest classifier model with GridSearch hyperparameter tuning on car sale data.

Electric vehicle sales are rapidly increasing, with a reported increase from 0.2% to 4.6% of total vehicle sales from 2011 to 2021; therefore, it is becomingly increasingly important for car manufacturers to understand where potential future consumers are coming from. 
If it were possible to predict the brand of an electric vehicle purchased, given geographical information about the consumer, it would be very beneficial to these manufacturers at various levels of their corporation. 
For example, being able to predict the brand for a given area, the likelihood of closing a sales deal for a local car dealership could be imputed. 
This could give manufacturers information about where to build more electric vehicle support infrastructure, such as charging stations, and licensing mechanics that specialize in their vehicles.
